Side effects to this game may not vary. All reactions have been proven the same: an urge to hit a baby, having blue vision, eating their own shit, having uncontrollable periods {both male and female}, listening to static in a bright red room and/or randomly yelling at their neighbor's wall asking for a Twinkie. See a doctor if any child has these symptoms or if they start having other strange behavior after one minute of playing this flash game.)\\n> QWOP is a game Chuck Norris can't even win.\\n"}}
