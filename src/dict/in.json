anything in the top 40. An Indie is, in fact, someone whos heart lies with indie, rock, alternative, music like that. You are all thinking of [scenesters]. An Indie Kid is, by no mean shape or form, a scenester. \\r\\n\\r\\nIndie Boys tend to be skinny, shy, with messy hair and a fringe. The hair must not be confused with emo hair, which is styled using disturbing quantaties of gel, wax, mousse and hairspray. Indie boys just can't be arsed to brush. Skinny jeans are more typical of the [scene kid], Indie boys prefer fairly loose fitting denim. A plain t-shirt or shirt are very popular, along with ancient battered converse, in black or blue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndie Girls normally have wavy hair that looks bedraggled, and dress not a million miles away from the boys, just with more feminine styles. Indie Girls generally don't really care about their appearence that much, but scrub up pretty darn well, as opposed to a [scene girl] who is the scum off the earth. Indie girls wear any sort of jeans, comfy and casual t-shirts and the same footwear as the boys.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother important difference between Indie Kids and [scene kids] is that indie kids are actually capable of having nice conversations with the bands they meet, as opposed to the scenester ego-boosting and myspace photo posing. \\r\\n\\r\\nIndie kids are friendly, cheerful and actually suprisingly non-elitest; I, as an Indie Kid(ette, maybe, as a girl) have many a time got down to the funky sounds of Snoop Dogg. Indie Kids are my solace in a sea of scenester scum.   \\n> Indie Kids, I salute you!!!\\n"},"indie music":{"w":"indie music","p":"","t":"独立音乐（independent music）"},"indiella":{"w":"indiella","p":"","t":"[医] 白色足霉菌素"},"indies":{"w":"indies","p":"'indiz","t":"n. 印度地方, 西印度群岛"},"indifference":{"w":"indifference","p":"in'difәrәns","t":"n. 不重视, 无兴趣, 漠不关心\\n[法] 中立, 不偏袒, 不重视"},"indifference curve":{"w":"indifference curve","p":"","t":"[经] 无差异曲线"},"indifference level":{"w":"indifference level","p":"","t":"[经] 无差异水平"},"indifference map":{"w":"indifference map","p":"","t":"[经] 无差异图"},"indifferency":{"w":"indifferency","p":"","t":"n. 不关心, 不计较, 冷淡, 无关紧要, 不在乎, 中立, 中性"},"indifferent":{"w":"indifferent","p":"in'difәrәnt","t":"a. 漠不关心的, 无重要性的, 中立的\\n[医] 中性的, 无作用的, 无亲和力的, 淡漠的"},"indifferent cells":{"w":"indifferent cells","p":"","t":"[医] 平凡细胞"},"indifferent dye":{"w":"indifferent dye","p":"","t":"[医] 中性染剂"},"indifferent electrode":{"w":"indifferent electrode","p":"","t":"[化] 惰性电极\\n[医] 无效电极, 弥散电极"},"indifferent electrolyte":{"w":"indifferent electrolyte","p":"","t":"[化] 惰性电解质"},"indifferent epithelium":{"w":"indifferent epithelium","p":"","t":"[医] 未分化上皮"},"indifferent equilibrium":{"w":"indifferent equilibrium","p":"","t":"[化] 随遇平衡"},"indifferent gas":{"w":"indifferent gas","p":"","t":"[化] 惰性气; 惰性气体"},"indifferent genitalia":{"w":"indifferent genitalia","p":"","t":"[医] 未分化生殖器"},"indifferent judge":{"w":"indifferent judge","p":"","t":"[法] 铁面无私的法官"},"indifferent oxide":{"w":"indifferent oxide","p":"","t":"[医] 中性氧化物"},"indifferent ponad":{"w":"indifferent ponad","p":"","t":"[医] 未分化性腺"},"indifferent solvent":{"w":"indifferent solvent","p":"","t":"[化] 惰性溶剂; 非质子传递溶剂"},"indifferent stimulus":{"w":"indifferent stimulus","p":"","t":"[医] 无关刺激物"},"indifferent tissue":{"w":"indifferent tissue","p":"","t":"[医] 未分化组织"},"indifferent water":{"w":"indifferent water","p":"","t":"[医] 弱盐泉水, 中性泉水"},"indifferentism":{"w":"indifferentism","p":"in'difәrәntizm","t":"n. 冷淡主义, 宗教信仰无差别论"},"indifferentist":{"w":"indifferentist","p":"ɪndɪfrən'tɪst","t":" 冷淡主义者"},"indifferently":{"w":"indifferently","p":"in'difәrәntli","t":"adv. 不关心地, 冷淡地, 淡然地"},"indiffusible":{"w":"indiffusible","p":",indi'fju:zәbl","t":"不扩散的, 未扩散的"},"indiffusion":{"w":"indiffusion","p":"","t":"体内扩散; 向内扩散; 不扩散"},"indigen":{"w":"indigen","p":"'indidʒәn","t":"n. 本地人, 土著,当地的动物或植物"},"indigence":{"w":"indigence","p":"'indidʒәns","t":"n. 贫乏, 穷困的人们"},"indigency":{"w":"indigency","p":"","t":"n. 贫困, 贫穷"},"indigene":{"w":"indigene","p":"'indidʒi:n","t":"n. 土生的动植物, 土著"},"indigenes":{"w":"indigenes","p":"","t":"(indigene 的复数) n. 土生的动植物, 土著"},"indigenization":{"w":"indigenization","p":"in,didʒinai'zeiʃәn;-ni'z-","t":"n. 本地化, 本国化"},"indigenize":{"w":"indigenize","p":"in'didʒinaiz","t":"vt.使本地化, 使本国化"},"indigenized":{"w":"indigenized","p":"","t":"(indigenize 的过去分词) vt.使本地化, 使本国化"},"indigenous":{"w":"indigenous","p":"in'didʒinәs","t":"a. 本土的, 国产的, 固有的\\n[医] 原产的, 本土的"},"indigenous capital":{"w":"indigenous capital","p":"","t":"[经] 本国资本"},"indigenous fault":{"w":"indigenous fault","p":"","t":"[计] 固有故障"},"indigenous language":{"w":"indigenous language","p":"ɪnˈdɪdʒənəs ˈlæŋɡwidʒ","t":" 土语"},"indigenous law":{"w":"indigenous law","p":"","t":"[法] 固有法"},"indigenous method":{"w":"indigenous method","p":"","t":"[法] 土方法, 土法"},"indigenously":{"w":"indigenously","p":"ɪn'dɪdʒɪnəslɪ","t":"adv. 本土"},"indigenousness":{"w":"indigenousness","p":"","t":"n. indigenous的变形"},"indigent":{"w":"indigent","p":"'indidʒәnt","t":"a. 贫乏的, 穷困的"},"indigently":{"w":"indigently","p":"ɪn'dɪdʒəntlɪ","t":"adv. 贫乏地, 穷困地"},"indigents":{"w":"indigents","p":"","t":"(indigent 的复数) a. 贫乏的, 穷困的"},"indigest":{"w":"indigest","p":",indi'dʒest,in'dai-","t":"<古><罕> vt.不能消化,不消化\\nvi.不被消化,不消化"},"indigested":{"w":"indigested","p":",indi'dʒestid, indai'dʒestid","t":"a. 未消化的, 考虑不充分的, 杂乱的, 条理不清的"},"indigestibility":{"w":"indigestibility","p":"","t":"n. 难消化, 难理解"},"indigestible":{"w":"indigestible","p":".indi'dʒestәbl","t":"a. 不消化的, 难消化的, 难理解的\\n[医] 不消化的"},"indigestibleness":{"w":"indigestibleness","p":"","t":"[网络] 消化不良"},"indigestion":{"w":"indigestion","p":".indi'dʒestʃәn","t":"n. 消化不良\\n[医] 消化不良, 不消化"},"indigestive":{"w":"indigestive","p":".indi'dʒestiv","t":"a. 消化不良的, 引起不消化的"},"Indigirka":{"w":"Indigirka","p":",indi'^irkә","t":"印迪吉尔卡河[苏联西伯利亚东部]"},"Indigirka River":{"w":"Indigirka River","p":"","t":"[网络] Indigirka河"},"indigitation":{"w":"indigitation","p":"in,didʒi'teiʃәn","t":"n.
